APCS
====
This is a repository which has a lot of code which I created during my year in APCS. Feel free to use any of this code to learn or experience what code is like yourself.

I have been updating this repository with labs which I have been working on during my freshmen year at college. It is mostly primitive stuff, but hopefully starting next semester it'll pick up and I'll start a new repository for that.
